// This is a redux 'Slice' file.
// It contains code for a global redux variable, which may be accessed by any component.
// Note that redux variables may not be functions!


// The redux variable must have an initial state.

// The reducers are functions that can be accessed to change the state.

// the select function allows any component to get the current state.
